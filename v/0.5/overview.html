<p>Digital Construction Occupancy ontology covers the factors affecting occupants' comfort, including
indoor air quality and building acoustics. It is based on the DNA (Drivers, Needs, Actions) model
developed in the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/680708">HIT2GAP project</a>.
</p>

<p>
The class <tt>dicob:OccupancyComfort</tt> class represents the Needs of the DNAs, with additional
subclasses for <tt>dicob:ThermalComfort</tt>, <tt>dicob:VisualComfort</tt> and
<tt>dicob:AcousticComfort</tt>. The comfort profile of the user is characterized by comfort
requirements that could be defined by fixed limits expressed in terms of
<tt>dicob:EnvironmentalPreference</tt> over specific environmental properties such as temperature,
luminance, or db level.
</p>

<p>
As part of the occupantsâ€™ behaviours analysis, occupancy/presence profiling related parameters is
considered at each specific residential unit (<tt>dice:ResidentialUnit</tt>). The
<tt>dicob:OccupancyProfile</tt> class represents the occupancy profiling model over a specific time
frame, with the model parameters to be specified through the <tt>dicob:occupancyParameters</tt>
class.

The visual overview of the Occupancy ontology is presented below.
